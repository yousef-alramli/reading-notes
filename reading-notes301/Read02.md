# React: Component Lifecycle Events
*What are component lifecycle events?*
React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

- as it seems from the diagram that above  render step comes before  the componentDidMount step.

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

- When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. all occur in this  order during mounting:
    1. static getDerivedStateFromProps
    2. render
    3. componentDidMount
    4. UNSAFE_componentWillMount

### static getDerivedStateFromProps()

This method exists for rare cases where the state relies on changes in props over time.
### render()

Render is the only required method in a class component. It will examine this.props and this.state when called. The render function should not modify the component state because it would cause a lot of bugs by changing the state every time it rerenders. I also should not directly interact with the browser. render will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false. Here is an example of using render.

### componentDidMount()  
  
This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, donâ€™t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
setState() can be called here, but it should be used sparingly, because it will cause a rerender, which can lead to perfomance issues.
Here we use componentDidMount() to connect to the YouTube API and get videos when the components is rendered.

### shouldComponentUpdate()  
  
The default behavior in react is to rerender after every state change. Setting shouldComponentUpdate() to false allows you to prevent this from happening. This is in order to optimize performance. If you want to use this method, it may be better to use PureComponent instead, which performs a shallow comparison of props and state. If you do decide to use this method, be sure to check the previous props and state with the current props and state. If shouldComponentUpdate() returns false, then UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(), render(), and componentDidUpdate() will not be invoked.
### getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
This is another rarely used method that allows you to capture a picture of the DOM to check it before actually changing anything on the DOM.
### componentDidUpdate()
This method is useful for performing network requests after a change has occurred.

### componentWillUnmount()

This method allows you to clean up the DOM and netwrok requests/ subscriptions.

## Things I want to know more about.
for now i need to have more knoewedge about react, classes and the arrow function since its new for me.
