## Expressions and operators

### Expressions
An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. The value may be a number, a string, or a logical value. Conceptually, there are two types of expressions: those that assign a value to a variable, and those that simply have a value. For example, the expression x = 7.
** JavaScript has the following kinds of expressions:**

* Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example
String: evaluates to a character string, for example "Fred" or "234"
* Logical: evaluates to true or false
### Operators
JavaScript has arithmetic, string, and logical operators. There are both binary and unary operators. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:

operand1 operator operand2

For example, 3 + 4 or x * y

A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.
For example x++ or ++x.

## loops
Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.

**The three most common types of loops are:**

+ for
+ while
+ do while
