### Fixed Mindset
The **Fixed Mindset** is when some people see their qualities as fixed traits that cannot change based on their inherited.  
Let's take example on driving the people with the fixed mindset believe rather say "I can drive" or "I can't drive" they won't say like i can learn it's like black or white thing.  
### Growth Mindset
The **Growth Mindset** is when someone believe that he can learn anything and thereâ€™s nothing impassible, For the same exaple from before on the driving someone with growth mindset if he can't drive he would say i will learn and try and eventually i will be able to drive.    
We can see that the **Growth Mindset** are positive and looking forward and that what should we all be.
