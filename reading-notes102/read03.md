# HTML Summary  

HTML is the universal markup language for the Web. HTML lets you format text, add graphics, create links, input forms, frames and tables, etc., and save it all in a text file that any browser can read and display.

The key to HTML is the tags, which indicates what content is coming up.

### The main element parts
* The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
* The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
* The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
* The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
