## Images

Controlling the size and alignment of
your images using CSS keeps rules that
affect the presentation of your page in
the CSS and out of the HTML markup.
### Controlling the size of images in css
You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.

### AligNing images Using CSS
There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved.
1. The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image
(such as the small class in our
example).
2. New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.

### Centering images Using CSS
Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image.
1. On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

### Background Images
The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows
the letters url, and it is put
inside parentheses and quotes.
### Background Position
When an image is not being
repeated, you can use the
background-position
property to specify where in the
browser window the background
image should be placed.
This property usually has a pair
of values. The first represents
the horizontal position and the
second represents the vertical.

### Img Rollovers & Sprites
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
rollover) and a third style when
they click on it.

### Contrast of background images
If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low
contrast in order for the text to be legible.

1. High Contrast.
The majority of photographs
have quite a high contrast, which
means that they are not ideal for
use as a background image.
2. Low Contrast.
Image editing applications such
as Photoshop and GIMP have
tools that allow you to manually
adjust your images to have lower
contrast.
3. Screen.
To overlay text on an image with
high contrast, you can place a
semi-transparent background
color (or "screen") behind the
text to improve legibility.
## Practical Information

To wrap up the book we are going to look
at some practical information that will
help you launch a successful site.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- The Basics.

Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.
- On-Page Techniques.

On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines
- Off-Page Techniques.

Getting other sites to link to you
is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help
determine how to rank your
site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.

### On-Page SEO
In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.

1. Page Title.  
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the < title> element which lives
inside the < head> element.
2. URL / Web Address  
The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.
3. Headings  
If the keywords are in a heading
< hn> element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.
4. Text  
Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.
5. Link Text  
Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").
6. Image Alt Text  
Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.
7. Page Descriptions  
The description also lives inside
the < head> element and is
specified using a < meta> tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the results
pages of search engines.)

### How to Identify Keywords and Phrases
1. Brainstorm  
List down the words that
someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure
to include the various topics,
products or services your site is
about.
2. Organize  
Group the keywords into
separate lists for the different
sections or categories of your
website.
3. Research  
There are several tools that let
you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional
keywords you might like to
consider.
4. Compare  
It is very unlikely that your
site will appear at the top of
the search results for every
keyword. This is especially true
for topics where there is a lot
of competition. The more sites
out there that have already been
optimized for a given keyword,
the harder it will be for you to
rise up the search results when
people search on that term.
5. Refine  
Now you need to pick which
keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each
section of your site.   
6. Map  
Now that you have a refined list
of keywords, you know which
have the most competition, and
which ones are most relevant,
it is time to start picking which
keywords you will use for each
page.
### How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?
The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are
likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are
coming to your site.
### Domain Names & Hosting
- DOMAIN NAMES  
Your domain name is your web
address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
co.uk). There are many websites
that allow you to register domain
names. Usually you will have to
pay an annual fee to keep that
domain name.

- WEB HOSTING   
 So that other people can see
your site, you will need to upload
it to a web server. Web servers
are special computers that are
constantly connected to the
Internet. They are specially set
up to serve web pages when
they are requested.
- Hosted Services  
There are a number of online
services that allow you to point
your domain name to their
servers. Blogging platforms such
as WordPress.com, Tumblr,
and Posterous, or e-commerce
platforms such as Big Cartel and
Shopify provide the servers that
your site is hosted on. If you are
using a platform like this you
will not need your own hosting
for the website, although you
often still need hosting for your
email. If this is the case, some
web hosting companies offer
packages that will just offer
email services.
