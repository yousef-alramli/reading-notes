**Markdown**is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.  

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

  **For example:**
+ To denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One).
+ To make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**).
